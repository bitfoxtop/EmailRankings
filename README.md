# EmailRankings
Here I got the statistics for emails in the public tech mailing lists. The statistics was done in Apache Spark.

The report has three parts included:

1. Statistics for the number of email domains
2. Statistics for the number of email TLDs
3. Statistics for the words appearing in message bodies

The reports are in data dir. I would update them periodically.

For privacy reasons I didn't keep the email data.
